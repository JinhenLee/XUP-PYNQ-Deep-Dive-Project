# XUP-PYNQ-Deep-Dive-Project
This is a simple implementation of the whack-a-mole game with the Xilinx PYNQ Z2 board.

To start the game, run the python code with switch 1 (SW1) in the ON position. One LED will flash at a time randomly. The player will then attempt to press the button next to the LED being flashed. If the player hits the correct button, all LEDs will flash simultaneously!

Toggle switch 0 (SW0) to reset the LEDs and pause the game for 5 seconds. After that the game will resume!

Have fun!
